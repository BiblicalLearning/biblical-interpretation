## About This Study

Understanding Scripture requires more than simply reading words on a page — it demands careful attention to context, audience, and purpose. Yet before we discuss method and technique, we must acknowledge a fundamental truth: **the Bible is a spiritual book that requires spiritual illumination**.

This framework provides six essential questions:

1. **When was this written?**
2. **Who was the original audience?**
3. **What is the central topic?**
4. **Who is speaking?**
5. **Is this referencing Old Testament fulfillment?**
6. **Is this referencing future fulfillment?**

- **John 16:13** - Spirit guides into all truth
- **John 14:26** - Spirit teaches all things
- **Romans 8:6-7** - Carnal mind vs. spiritual mind

### Study Foundation
- **2 Timothy 2:15** - Rightly dividing the word of truth

## Key Concepts

### The Foundation
Biblical understanding is not primarily an intellectual achievement — it is a spiritual gift. Begin with prayer, not analysis.

### Scripture Was Written FOR Us But Not TO Us
Every letter had specific first-century recipients. Understanding the original audience prevents misappropriation.

### Context Is King
A text without a context is a pretext for whatever we want it to say.

### Time Indicators Matter
"Soon," "at hand," "this generation," "in a little while" — these phrases help determine the timeframe of fulfillment.

### The Goal
Move from "What does this verse mean to me?" to "What did this mean to them, and how does that truth apply to my life?"

## The Truth

The wisest methodology without the Spirit produces only dead orthodoxy. The simplest believer with a humble heart and the Spirit's guidance will understand more than the proudest scholar relying on human wisdom alone.

**This is how we rightly divide the word of truth.**
